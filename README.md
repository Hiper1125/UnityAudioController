- Place it in your main scene, it won't be destroyed when the scene change.
- It will get rid of multiples AudioListner and it will work as the main audio listener.
- Play a 2D Sound (AudioManager.Instance`.Play2DSound(AudioClip, Volume)`).
- Play a 3D Sound (AudioManager.Instance`.Play3DSound(AudioClip, Position, Volume)`).
- Play a looping Music (AudioManager.Instance`.PlayMusic(AudioClip, Volume)`).
- Stop a looping Music (AudioManager.Instance`.StopMusic(AudioSource)`).
- All the tracks will be played in two separates channel, one for the music and one for the sound effects. The general mixer channel will control both of them, 
- Change volume of a Mixer Channel (AudioManager.Instance`.SetVolume(MixerChannel, Volume)`).
